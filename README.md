## Introduction

Katy Stores is a Fictional retail store with branches all over the USA. They have decided to migrate from the traditional data metric monitoring to Power BI and Iâ€™ve been tasked with creating a report that meets the following conditions:

1.	There must be a map visual that shows the states where our stores are and the value of the store in sales
2.	We must be able to enlarge this map visual for presentation purposes
3.	We must be able to swap all visuals for more context on the visual.
4.	We must be able to filter all visuals by Year, Region and Category.
5.	Try to keep it as compact as possible. 

## Key Questions and KPIs

**kpi**
- Total Sales : How much have we sold from the earliest entered date to the latest
- Total Profit: What is the total Profit from the sales
- Average Order Value: What is the value of each order on average
- Sales YOY: what is the sales growth between this period and the last year
- Profit Margin: What our current profit margin
- Average discount: on average, how much is discounted from each transaction
- Total Quantity Ordered: How many products have been ordered till date
- Total Number of Orders: How many times have we received orders till date
- Order Fulfillment: on average, how long does it take to ship a product when it is ordered
- Total Products Available: How many Products do we offer
- Number of Locations: How many locations have we shipped to
- Average profit per order: On average, how much do we make in profit for each order.

**Key Questions**

- Sales by State
- Sales Trend
- Sales Trend Forecast
- Busiest Days of the week
- Most Ordered Products
- Least Ordered Products

**Skills Shown:**

- Advanced Card Visuals to display two KPIs in one card without using custom visuals
- Bookmarking
- Modelling
- Whitespace Management
- Visualization

## Data Sourcing

![](https://github.com/eloka11222/Superstore-sales-/blob/main/Power%20query.jpg)
The data was sourced from Kaggle as a CSV document which after which I did the data formatting in excel and then completed the data cleaning on power BI


## Modelling

the model was built on a star schema with a 1 to many relationship between the facts and dimension tables. 

## Visualisation

using Bookmarks, I was able to compress the visuals to be able to swap visuals and navigate from a visual to another. 
I was also able to use a single card to show two KPIs which further compressed the entire visual making it compact. 

Conclusion
This project was used to highlight the power of bookmarking and conserving space for visualization. It helped me create this app like report and perfected my skills in bookmarking.
